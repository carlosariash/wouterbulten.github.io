A few years ago I discovered the [fastest option](/blog/cooking/the-quest-for-a-perfect-mousse-part-1/) to make chocolate mousse using a siphon for almost instant results. Although it is still the fastest option, I tend to use it less and less as it lacked the richness of a *perfect* chocolate mousse. Instead I have replaced the recipe with a new version that I have used many times since.

The recipe has been based on one I found on the [Callebaut](https://www.callebaut.com/en-US/chocolate-video/technique/mousse/creme-anglaise) website. Some of the steps and ingredients have been changed after testing it out.

The base of this chocolate mousse is a rich and delicate crème anglaise, which can be difficult to make, but practice makes perfect. The crème is an absolutely necessary part of this recipe and definitely worth the effort!

# (Dark) chocolate mousse

Recipe for a rich dark chocolate mousse that is very versatile. The mousse can be used as a basis for an entremet (a mousse cake), poured into silicon molds and frozen, and enjoyed on its own.


## Ingredients

- 200g + 25g cream, 35% fat, unsweetened
- 25g whole milk
- 25 egg yolks
- 40-65g sugar (depending on the chocolate, see note below)
- 125g dark chocolate, I used [Cacao Barry Ocoa 70.4%](https://www.cacao-barry.com/en-US/chocolate-couverture-cocoa/chd-n70ocoa/ocoa)

### Selecting the right chocolate

The choice of chocolate is an very important part of any chocolate mousse recipe. Certainly, the type of chocolate influences the taste of the mousse but, more importantly, also has an effect on the texture:

> If you used chocolate with a lower fluidity (i.e. containing less cocoa butter), it would yield a chocolate mousse with a really soft texture after crystallisation. It wouldn’t be solid enough to hold on a cake or inside a cake with the weight of different layers of cake filling on top. If you used chocolate with a higher fluidity (i.e. containing more cocoa butter) you’d get a chocolate mousse with a grainy, very solid and fatty texture, which would look and taste unappealing. -- [Callebaut fluidity explanation](https://www.callebaut.com/en-GB/chocolate-technique/troubleshooting/fluidity-mousse)

Most professional brands of chocolate display the fluidity using a *drop system*. Callebaut, for example, uses the following descriptions:

> 1. Chocolate with a one-drop fluidity: great for infusing e.g. fillings, butter cream or ice cream with a hint of chocolate taste;
2. Chocolate with a two-drop fluidity: perfect for large moulded chocolate figures;
3. Chocolate with a three-drop fluidity: extremely versatile, ideal for any application;
4. Chocolate with a four-drop fluidity: best choice for moulded chocolates with a thin chocolate shell or (sharply) angular chocolate moulds;
5. Chocolate with a five-drop fluidity: excellent for applying a thin layer of chocolate on top of biscuits with a large surface.

Within this system we are looking for a chocolate with three drops, this results in a mousse with a nice texture. A three-drops chocolate corresponds to a chocolate that contains around 37% cocoa butter.

It is possible to deviate from this system. I, for example, sometimes mix chocolates to achieve a certain flavour or explicitly try to get a different texture. Just remember, in general the closer to the three drops the better.  

No professional chocolate available? You can use store-bought general brands but keep in mind that the end product can differ slightly due to changes in cocoa butter content.

<img style="max-width: 300px" src="/assets/images/recipes/Tanzanie_en.png" alt="The type of chocolate directly influences the end result. For the best result, try to find some professional chocolate 'callets' (or drops), these are easy to use and will result in a better mousse.">

### Sugar

The amount of sugar that this recipe requires is dependent on the type of chocolate and your personal taste. Personally, I prefer a dark chocolate mousse that is not to sweet and tend to pair this with a sweeter garnish (like caramelized pears). A more bitter mousse also pairs perfectly with another more sweeter mousse.

The table below can be used as a reference for selecting the amount of sugar. The percentages are based on the amount of chocolate, e.g. a 28% means that you have to take 28% of the weight of the chocolate as sugar. The amounts in grams are pre-calculated for this recipe.


| Type of chocolate (cocoa solids %) | Sweet side | Bitter side | My preference |
|------------------------------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Milk (33%)                         |            |             |               |
| Dark (54%)                         | 25% (21g)  | 8% (10g)    | 12% (15g)     |
| Extra dark (70%)                   | 28% (35g)  | 10% (13g)   | 16% (20g)     |

*Note:* This table is a work in progress and will be updated when I try out more combinations. Use the "sweet-bitter" values as a rough range and adjust to your personal taste. The values in "my preference" are based on actual combinations I tried.

The combinations I've tested so far:

  <tr>
    <th>Type of chocolate</th>
    <th>Percentage sugar<br>(based on weight of chocolate)</th>

## Recipe

1. Gently semi-whip 200g of the cream until you get soft peaks. Reserve in the fridge.
2. Combine egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl. The bowl should be big enough to contain both the eggs and the liquids (milk and cream).
3. Combine the milk and remainder of the cream in a saucepan. Bring to a low boil. If you have a thermometer: a temperature of around 70&deg;C is enough.
4. Temper the eggs by slowing pouring the heated cream mixture in to the egg yolks.
5. Make a *crème anglaise*: Return egg/cream mixture to the saucepan and heat until the mixture reaches 82&deg;C. Make sure to whisk continuously to prevent an uneven heating and to incorporate air bubbles. You can also test whether the crème anglaise is ready without a thermometer: after heating, the mixture should coat the back of a spoon and not spread out when you make a line with your fingers.
4. Melt the chocolate in the microwave or using a double boiler.
5. Combine crème anglaise with the chocolate. Make sure to mix it well but avoid creating (large) air bubbles. You can use a stick blender or do this by hand.
6. When the chocolate crème anglaise is around 38 degrees you can start adding the whipped cream. Work in batches and only add the new cream when the last batch is fully incorporated. If you add the cream when the chocolate is still to warm the mousse will collapse.
7. Transfer the mousse to a piping bag and directly pour into the molds or final serving dish. Do not let the mousse cool inside the piping bag.
8. Freeze the molds, or let the mousse cool in the fridge.


# Pairing ideas

This mousse recipe can be used for many purposes. As a standalone dish I tend to pair it with caramelized pears and some white chocolate mousse.
