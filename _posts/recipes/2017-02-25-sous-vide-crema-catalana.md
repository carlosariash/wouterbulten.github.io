Sous vide crème brûlée is an easy to make yet delicious dessert. What's even better is the Crema Catalana version of this recipe. Traditionally, crema Catalana is made with milk and some kind of thickener where crème brûlée is made with eggs and primarily cream. However, I prefer the custard base recipe of crème brûlée with the flavors of crema Catalana; so this recipe is a combination of both.


# Ingredients

- Base custard ingredients, see [crème brûlée recipe]({% post_url recipes/2015-10-16-sous-vide-creme-brulee %}).
- Star anise
- Cinnamon stick
- Orange zest (from 1 orange)
- Citrus zest (from 1 citron)

# Recipe

The recipe is the same as for the [crème brûlée]({% post_url recipes/2015-10-16-sous-vide-creme-brulee %}). When tempering the custard in step 1 add the spices and zest. Infuse the creame and sieve after. The remainer of the steps are the same.
