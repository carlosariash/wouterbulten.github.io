description: "Vegan experiment: A dark chocolate crème mimicking the richness of an egg-based dessert."
---

Eggs and cream are the staple food of (classic) desserts. Flans, crème brûlée, crema Catalana, mousse, all are made with these basic ingredients. Sometimes directly but often using a custard base. 

Though, sometimes dietary requirements (or the need of a challenge) requires us to look for alternatives. In this case I was looking for a full vegan chocolate dessert that was as rich as intense as one based on cream and eggs. This is a challenge as a custard base gives a lot of body and flavor. 

## Ingredients

- almond milk, 400 grams
- sugar, 20 grams
- Dutch cocoa powder, 8 grams
- Salt, 0.4 grams
- Xantham gum, 0.25 grams
- Iota Carrageenan, 0.85 grams
- Kappa Carrageenan, 0.6 grams
- Dark chocolate, chopped, 160-220 grams
- Ramkins or other mold

The amount of chocolate controls the richness and the final texture of the dish. Use 220 grams of dark chocolate for a very rich and firm texture which can be easily cut. Use less for a more flan-like texture.

## Recipe

Mix sugar, cocoa powder, salt, xantham gum and both carrageenans. Place chocolate in a seperate bowl (large enough to contain the final mixture). Add dry ingredients to almond milk and mix thoroughly with a stick blender. Try to minimize the amount of bubbles.

Pour mixture in to a small sauce pan and turn on the heat. The mixture must reach at least 79&deg;C for the hydrocolloids to hydrate. 

Turn of the heat and pour the liquid on top of the chocolate. Let stand for a few moments to melt the chocolate. Use a stick blender to fully incorporate the chocolate in to the liquid. You need to end up with a smooth mixture.

Quickly pour the mixture in to your ramkins or other mold. The mixture gels below 45&deg;C. If you were not fast enough you can slowly reheat the mixture on the stove.

I poured my mixture in to a ring mold placed on a silicon mat and used a circular cutter to get individual portions. The chocolate crème can be paired with caramelized pear and nougatine.
