An entremet, or mousse cake, is a luxurious treat and a perfect way to end a dinner. It can also be made fully in advance. Generally, an entremet consists of multiple layers where typically the outer layer consists of a mousse and the lowest layer of cake. The entremet is finished with a (mirror) glaze, or in this instance, with a layer of red velvet cocoa butter.

This recipe is fairly complex and consists of multiple components that need to be made. Some of the components are also nice desserts on their own (for example the brownie or mousses). So, if you want to start slow feel free to try one of the individual parts first!

Components of the entremet:

1. Dark chocolate brownie
2. Raspberry jam
4. White chocolate mousse
3. Raspberry mousse
5. Dark chocolate mousse

Equipment needed throughout all the parts:

- Silicon entremet mold. *Alternative:* cake tin lined with acetate foil.
- Cake tin for making the brownie base that is slightly smaller than entremet mold. *Alternative:* cake tin that is slightly larger so that you can cut the brownie to the correct size after baking.
- (Optional) Small silicon spheres mold.

## 1. Dark chocolate brownie

### Ingredients

- 80g butter, unsalted
- 40g granulated sugar
- 40g dark brown sugar
- 70g eggs
- 35g all-purpose flower
- 65g dark chocolate
- 0.5g salt
- baking ring
{: .ingredient-list}

These measurements are enough for a small disk-shaped brownie. Consider doubling the quantities if you would like to have more.

### Steps

Let all ingredients come to room temperature. Heat the oven to 160 82&deg;C.

Mix the butter and sugar, can be done by hand or using a machine. After mixing, add the eggs and mix again.

Sieve the flower and salt and add to the mixture.

Melt the chocolate (microwave or double boiler) and add to the mixture.

Fill a baking ring/tin with the mixture. Use a baking ring that is slightly smaller than your entremet mold. You can also use a larger mold and later cut the brownie to the correct size.

Put the tin in the oven for 20-25 minutes, depending on your oven and the size of your tin. The brownie is done when the middle does not 'wobble' when you move the tin, the top has a paper-like crust and the sides are starting to come lose from the tin.

*As the brownie acts as a base of the entremet, it is less problematic if it is slightly overdone. So don't worry when the brownie is a bit less moist than what you would expect from a regular brownie.*

Let the brownie cool to room temperature. After cooling cut it to the correct size and place in the freezer until the last step. In my case, I also removed the middel part of the brownie.

## 2. Raspberry jam

*This step can be skipped by using store-bought raspberry jam.*

### Ingredients

- Raspberry puree (or fresh/froze raspberries pureed using a blender)
- Semi-sweet jam sugar (sugar with added pectin)
- Splash of lemon juice
{: .ingredient-list}

### Steps

Add puree, jam sugar and lemon juice to a small pot. Let the mixture cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.

## 3. White chocolate mousse spheres

This part can also be done without a silicon sphere mold.

## 2. Dark chocolate mousse

This dark chocolate mousse is the last part of our entremet and should be made when all other components are ready and fully frozen. This mousse recipe can also be used on its own as it is a very rich tasting mousse. The mousse is stable enough to be poured in to shapes and frozen.

This mousse recipe was adapted from the [Callebaut crème anglaise mousse](https://www.callebaut.com/en-US/chocolate-video/technique/mousse/creme-anglaise) recipe.

### Ingredients

- 200g + 25g cream, 35% fat, unsweetened
- 25g whole milk
- 25 egg yolks
- 40-65g sugar (depending on the chocolate, see note below) (CHECK THIS VALUE)
- 125g dark chocolate, I used [Cacao Barry Ocoa 70.4%](https://www.cacao-barry.com/en-US/chocolate-couverture-cocoa/chd-n70ocoa/ocoa)
{: .ingredient-list}

*Choice of chocolate:* The choice of chocolate is up to you. I made this recipe with a rich dark chocolate with 70.4% cocoa and a 38% fat content. If using a dark chocolate (60% and up) you can use up to 65 grams of sugar. If using a chocolate with a lower cocoa content I advice you to lower the sugar content to around 40 grams.

### Steps

Gently semi-whip 200g of the cream until you get soft peaks. Reserve in the fridge.

Combine egg yolks and sugar in a bowl large enough to contain the eggs and the milk and cream mixture from the next step.

Combine the milk and leftover cream in a saucepan. Bring to a low boil. Temper the eggs by slowing pouring the heated cream mixture in to the egg yolks. Return mixture to the saucepan and heat until the mixture reaches 82&deg;C. Make sure to whisk the mixture continuously to prevent an uneven heating and to incorporate air bubbles. You can test whether the crème anglaise is ready: after heating the mixture should coat the back of a spoon and should not spread out when you make a line with your fingers.

Melt the chocolate in the microwave or using a double boiler.

Combine crème anglaise with the chocolate. Make sure to mix it well but avoid creating (large) air bubbles.

When the chocolate crème anglaise is around 38 degrees you can start adding the whipped cream. Work in batches and only add the new cream when the last batch is fully incorporated.

The chocolate mousse is now ready. Poor the mousse in a piping bag and reserve for the next step.

## 6. Assembly of the mousse cake

### Ingredients

- Brownie (from above, frozen)
- Raspberry mousse filled with white chocolate spheres (from above, frozen)
- Dark chocolate mousse
- Raspberry jam (store-bought, or above)
- Red-velvet cocoa butter spray
- Entremet silicon mold, or round cake tin
{: .ingredient-list}

Place a layer of chocolate mousse in the base of your mold. Then, with a spatula, spread the mousse around the sides of the mold and make sure that they are covered. This prevents holes in the outer mousse layer.

Lay the raspberry mousse layer on top of the chocolate mousse, followed by the brownie layer. Press gently to spread the chocolate mousse around the sides of the layers.

Add more mousse to the mold to fill the all the sides. Spread the mousse on top and make it even using a spatula or palette knife.

Cover the filled silicon mold with cling wrap en put in the freezer. Freezing will take at least 6 hours (varies on the size of your mold and temperature of the freezer). The mousse cake must be completely frozen before removing from the mold.

When the cake is completely frozen, remove the mold and put the cake on a bowl (or something else to raise it). Spray the mold with the cocoa butter spray and let un-freeze in the fridge.

Instead of the velvet spray you can also cover the cake with a mirror glaze or keep the chocolate mousse as the outer layer. The velvet spray is just for show and does not add any significant flavor.

Just before serving you can add any garnishes of your choosing. I opted for some chocolate decorations in green.
