As part of our publication on [epithelium segmentation using deep learning and immunohistochemistry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37257-4) we published our dataset on Zenodo: the [PESO dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/1485967#.XT8F0ugzb8A). The dataset is free to use under the BY-NC-SA Creative Commons license.

## Contents of the dataset

The PESO dataset consists of a `training` and `test` part. For the training part the reference standard is included. This set consists of:

- 62 whole-slide images, exported at a pixel resolution of 0.48mu/pixels.
- 62 Raw color deconvolution masks containing the P63&CK8/18 channel of the color deconvolution operation. These masks mark all regions that are stained by either P63 or CK8/18 in the IHC version of the slides.
- 25 color deconvolution masks (N=25) on which manual annotations have been made. Within these regions, stain and other artifacts have been removed.
- 62 training masks (N=62) that have been used to train the main network of our paper. These masks are generated by a trained U-Net on the corresponding IHC slides.

The test set consists of:

- 40 whole-slide images, exported at a pixel resolution of 0.48mu/pixels.
