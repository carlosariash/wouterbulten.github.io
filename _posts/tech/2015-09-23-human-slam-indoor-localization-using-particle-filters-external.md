A key problem (or challenge) within smart spaces is indoor localization: making estimates of usersâ€™ whereabouts. Without such information, systems are unable to react on the presence of users or, sometimes even more important, their absence. This can range from simply turning the lights on when someone enters a room to customizing the way devices interact with a specific user.

Even more important for a system to know where users exactly are, is to know where users are relative to the devices it can control or use to sense the environment. This relation between user and device location is an essential input to these systems. A central question in this field is therefore:

> What are the locations of devices in a smart space and what are the current locations of users relative to these devices?

During my graduation project at DoBots I worked on an algorithm, called SLAC : Simultaneous Localization and Configuration, to solve this double localization problem: finding position of users and devices simultaneously.  With SLAC we aimed to simultaneously locate both the user and the devices of a system deployed in an indoor environment. I wrote an article on the [DoBots website](https://dobots.nl/2015/09/03/human-slam-indoor-localization-using-particle-filters/) about my project.
