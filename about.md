I am Wouter Bulten, currently an AI master student at [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl), doing an internship at [Almende](http://www.almende.org) &amp; [DoBots](http://www.dobots.nl) and working as a web/software developer at [123test](http://www.123test.com) [.com](http://www.123test.com) /[.nl](http://www.123test.nl).

Mai-Ai.org is a result of a overly ambitious project I did as part of my secondary school `thesis'. Now it is used as my personal blog and for various projects.

### Some previous projects/things I worked on?


* I have been chair of an annual AI symposium ([ACAIS](http://www.acais.nl)) and recently built the [new website](https://github.com/wouterbulten/acais-website) together with [Thijs van Nieuwdorp](http://tnieuwdorp.github.io/).
* Developed a wireless sensor node (the [DomuLink](http://www.domulink.com)) during my masters with two fellow students.
* Co-developed/hosted a workshop on Artificial Life simulations ([source](https://github.com/wouterbulten/ACAIS2013Workshop)).
* Published my BA thesis _Sharing Blood: A Decentralised Trust and Sharing Ecosystem based on the Vampire Bat_. The research focussed on the effect of cheaters on a reciprocal system/environment with possible applications in resource sharing; e.g. (ad-hoc) mesh networks where users need to share without a central controlling authority.
