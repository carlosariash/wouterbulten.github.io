    <p>Hi! I am Wouter Bulten. Currently I am working as a PhD candidate at Radboudumc. In my spare time I am also available as a freelance developer.
        You can read more about what I do and did on my <a href="/curriculum-vitae/">resume</a>.</p>

    <p>This website is a portfolio of things I work on and things I like (combinations possible!).</p>

    <p>I like to cook a wide range of dishes, some of which you can read more about on my <a href="/food">food blog</a>.</p>
