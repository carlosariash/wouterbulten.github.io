    <p>Hi! I am Wouter Bulten, an AI researcher and developer.</p>

    <p>This website is a portfolio of things I work on and things I like (combinations possible!).</p>
  </div>

I am Wouter Bulten, currently working as a software developer at [123test](http://www.123test.com) [.com](http://www.123test.com) /[.nl](http://www.123test.nl). I recently received my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl).

This blog is a result of my passion for technology and cooking: two very different fields which, when you look closer, have a lot in common. My way of improving and learning is writing about the things I learn; what better way than publishing this in the form of a blog?

### Some previous projects/things I worked on?

* Tried[^1] to build a fully autonomous robot, _Solen_, that could surive outside (in any garden) for a full year.
* I have been chair of the annual AI symposium [ACAIS](http://www.acais.nl), and recently built the [new website](https://github.com/wouterbulten/acais-website) together with [Thijs van Nieuwdorp](http://tnieuwdorp.github.io/).
* Developed a wireless sensor node (the [DomuLink](http://www.domulink.com)) during my masters with two fellow students.
* Co-developed/hosted workshops on Artificial Life simulations using Breve ([source](https://github.com/wouterbulten/ACAIS2013Workshop), [presentation]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/ACAIS2013_WorkshopPresentation.pdf), [docs]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/ACAIS2013Workshop_Instructions.pdf)) and microcontrollers with the MSP430[^2] ([presentation]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/ACAIS2014_WorkshopPresentation.pdf)).
* Worked on analysis and generation of text with the ultimate goal to create an intelligent chatbot as part of my secondary school 'thesis'.
* Published[^3] my BA thesis _Sharing Blood: A Decentralised Trust and Sharing Ecosystem based on the Vampire Bat_. The research focused on the effect of cheaters on a reciprocal system/environment with possible applications in resource sharing; e.g. (ad-hoc) mesh networks where users need to share without a central controlling authority.
